Before beginning this installation, make sure you have the following information
on hand: name of the database 'host' server, your username for database access,
and your database password.

1. Once you have uploaded the files to the server, you will need to configure
   SUMO with your specific settings.
   So, edit the file /sumo/configs/config.database.php yourself, is not any more
   difficult.


2. From the directory /sumo/install/ get the database_<your_db_type>.sql file 
   to create database tables for Sumo.
   Now run SQL query of this file using your database client, for ex phpMyAdmin.
   So, login to phpMyAdmin. If you do not know where or how to do this, please
   consult your hosting service provider.
   In some cases, you may have to choose which database you want. If this is the
   case, please choose using the dropdown box.
   To run a SQL query, click on "SQL" on the navigation bar.
   Enter the SQL code in the box provided.
   Click "Go".
   If all goes well, your SUMO database will now be succesfully entered.
   
   NOTE: you must have 18 tables
   
   
3. PHP configuration: register_globals must be OFF (find this option into your
   php.ini and change it if necessary).
